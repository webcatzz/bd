as SEAWORN ROOM
Salt swills in the thick air of the old room. The cloying stench of the ocean clogs the senses so completely it seems nearly impossible to move.

> Where am I?

	as SEAWORN ROOM
	Whirling waves swelling, falling apart, spitting, clawing, crashing into steep rocks; shifting, undulating, utterly obscure. Somewhere, ocean spray catches on a window pane. A few flecks land on skin.

	as INMOST POINT
	Your gut drops.

	as SEAWORN ROOM
	The decaying walls seem insufficient to guard you from the cold, but there is a warmth here nonetheless.

> Enough of this. Show me a play instead.

as SCUTTLING JUNEBUG
A gentle staccato pulls you out of stupor. A glimmer of irridescence vanishes in the darkness.

as CERTAINTY
Precisely one hundred and two kilometers directly above your head: a shooting star vanishes in the night sky.

Could you stop that?!

They should be here. It’s the day of our duel. Why wouldn't they be here? Why wouldn't he be here?

as FIFER
I have no idea.

as COWARD
do add_line("temp for logic (coward_grovel)")
This is horrible, oh, why- how could this happen to me?! I don’t want to shoot him... I don't want to die...

as FIFER
...Some time ago, I read a book about a Japanese warrior... a samurai, who would often turn up late to his own duels.
do add_line("temp for logic (coward_sit_down_next_to_fifer)")
The primary reason he made use of this strategy was that it forced his opponent to wait and contemplate their own death.

as COWARD
do add_line("temp for logic (coward_hesitates)")
And that is supposed to comfort me?!

as FIFER
do add_line("temp for logic (fifer_roll_eyes)")
No, I just thought it was interesting.

as COWARD
do add_line("temp for logic (coward_shoot_fifer)")
Bitch

as SEAWORN ROOM
Dim light pries through warped window-glass. You are anchored in an ocean of its own sort: books, compact discs, records, paper scraps, computer parts, and other paraphernalia bury every inch of the room. It is a well-cared for collection.

if Save.player_name == "June"

	You feel at home.

x else

x 	You feel yourself a stranger here.
